          "It was necessary to deploy the app using our APIs, and HE:Mobile made ​​it almost without question for us, super smoothly.
Through HE: Mobile speed we got our backlog, and their experience with mobile devices was key to achieving the results we expected."

        <blockquote>
          "Did you say I was surprised. During the two weeks of Startup Mobile Dev team gave a lesson in project management. We think maybe the scope was too big, but in the end everything worked out. And besides, they delivered something that is very important to us: the factor: 'Uau!'. Today I look to the app and say: 'Uau!'"

          "Working with HE:Mobile surpassed my expectations.
           It is very important to work with who help develop and structure their ideas, and with HE: Mobile was so. Much more than a team capable of accomplishing goals and tasks, I came across intelligent and creative people, which raised the level of my work in all spheres."

          É muito importante trabalhar com quem o ajuda a desenvolver e estruturar suas ideias, e com a HE:mobile foi assim. Muito mais do que uma equipe capaz de cumprir metas e tarefas, me deparei com pessoas inteligentes e criativas, que elevaram o nível do meu trabalho em todas as esferas."
