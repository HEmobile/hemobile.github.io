        <blockquote>
          "I would like to say that I was surprised. During the two weeks of Startup Mobile Dev, the team gave a lesson in project management. We thought that maybe the scope was too wide, but in the end it all worked out. And moreover, they delivered something that is very important to us: the factor: 'Wow!'. Today I look to the app and say: 'Wow!"

Far more than a team capable of accomplish goals and tasks, I came across intelligent and creative people, which increased the level of my work in all spheres."

          É muito importante trabalhar com quem o ajuda a desenvolver e estruturar suas ideias, e com a HE:mobile foi assim. Muito mais do que uma equipe capaz de cumprir metas e tarefas, me deparei com pessoas inteligentes e criativas, que elevaram o nível do meu trabalho em todas as esferas."
