            <strong>Client’s Idea</strong><br>
          At the first meeting, both client and team speak about the project and its short and long term vision.

          <li>
            <strong><a class="modalTrigger">Wireframe sketching</a></strong><br>
          Client and team design the pages as they imagine that the project will be developed.

              <h4>Wireframe sketching</h4>
              <span class="modalDay">Monday</span>
              <p>The objective of this stage is to extract everyone's main ideas (client's and team's) and, by communicating via the illustrations, agree on what needs to get done.</p>
              <p>When we speak of wireframe sketching, we literally mean a drawing of what you imagine your interface to be. Simple pen and paper drawing. <a href="/pdfs/exemplo-de-desenho.pdf" target="_blank">Check out an example!</a></p>
              <div class="modalEntry">
                <p><strong>1.</strong> Everyone from our team and the client sketches, individually, the interfaces as imagined;;</p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> The sketches should reflect the application's flow. How users should interact with the application, which elements must exist and things of that kind;</p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Everyone presents their sketches and there's a discussion regarding the best wireframes;</p>
                <p><strong>4.</strong> Creation of a final sketch, which becomes the delivery for the next phase.</p>

              <p>The main objective here is to find out what and how much effort is necessary for your development</p>
                <div class="modalEntry">
                  <p><strong>1.</strong>  After the team discusses the wireframes, we create a step-by-step walkthrough for each wireframe. We call these user stories,
                  where inside each, there are a bunch of tasks; </p>
                  <p><strong>2.</strong> At our workplace, we use boards to either list out or draw all of the necessary components to create each wireframe (data models, etc.);</p>
                  <p><strong>3.</strong> Each task has X points. Everyone on the team stipulates how many points they think the task is worth;</p>
                  <p><strong>4.</strong> The point system used is 1, 2, 4 or 8, which represent the team's effort in relation to a user story;</p>

              <p>After knowing the effort for each task, it's time to prioritize them and define which are the most important to get done for the week.</p>
                <div class="modalEntry">
                  <p><strong>1.</strong> The client re-arranges the tasks in order from most important to least important, regardless of effort;</p>
                  <p><strong>2.</strong> The team helps the client prioritize, pointing out any complexities of each task at hand;</p>
                  <p><strong>3.</strong> The client prioritizes an average of 30 points per person on the team. For example: a team with 2 people would deliver approximately 60 points;;</p>
                  <p><strong>4.</strong> At the end of priotization, client and team know what will be developed for that week;</p>
